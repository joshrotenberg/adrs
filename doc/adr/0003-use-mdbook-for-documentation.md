# 3. Use mdBook for documentation

Date: 2024-03-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

A solid documentation site is the backbone of any good software project. While the tool should have decent built in docs, 
the doc site can contain a lot more information, as well as general information about the project.

## Decision

`adrs` will have an [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook)] based documentation site.

## Consequences

Docs will be easier to navigate, search, and keep up to date.
