# Introduction

`adrs` is a command line tool for creating and managing [Architectural Decision Records](https://adr.github.io).
It is a Rust rewrite of the original [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools), attempting to balance backwards
compatibilty with new features.

See the [Resources](./resources.md) section for more information about ADRs in general.
