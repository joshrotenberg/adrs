Help out however you can. See [issues](https://github.com/joshrotenberg/adrs/issues) for ideas.

## Guidelines

### Compatibility

For now, keep additions compatible with the original [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools). New features
can be added, however, as long as they don't break existing functionality. In the future, the tool may
add incompatible features, but that will be a major version bump.

### Testing

Please write new and/or update current tests as appropriate. See the current test suite for examples.

### Documentation

All new or augmented features should have documentation.
